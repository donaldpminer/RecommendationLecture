# RecommendationLecture
A lecture I gave about recommendation engines at UMBC (75 minutes), which  goes over the basics of a user-based recommendation engine. I used Python, Pandas, and IPython Notebook.

To run this, you'll need to install pandas, matplotlib, and ipython. 

You can view the IPython Notebook in web form here: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/donaldpminer/RecommendationLecture/blob/master/Used-based%20Collaborative%20Filtering%20Lecture.ipynb

This tutorial uses the MovieLens data set. You can get it here:

I didn't commit it in the repo because it is big.
